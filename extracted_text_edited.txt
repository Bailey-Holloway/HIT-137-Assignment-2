relatively unchanged appearance of multiple ill defined opacities and tiny nodules in the right upper lobe follow up stated on the examination from day prior is again recommended new foci of

thiamine folate and a multivitamin his afib with rvr was initially treated with metoprolol then diltiazem his high ammonia levels were treated with lactulose his b l ankle fractures were followed by orthopedics the patient was severely agitated on more than one occassion during this hospitalization requiring three codes puples to be called as well as requiring restraints for protection of both the patient and the staff the patient was originally sent from the floor to the micu with delirium of unknown cause and severe agititation he required increased amounts of sedation and was returned to the floor after a ng tube was placed once returned to the floor the patient required less sedation was taken off of any benzodiazipines and only intermittently needed restraints the patient remained somnolent and delerious he pulled out his ng tube he was also febrile and rhoncorous on the floor he was initially treated with vancomycin and flagyl which was changed to azithro ceftriaxone flagyl he was scheduled to return to the or for revision of his right external fixation in preop holding he was found to be hypoxic and sent to the micu micu course morning of patient scheduled to return to or

respiratory status has remained stable with sp in the high s on room air pt is hemodynamically stable in chronic a flutter called out to floor on no further intensive care needs identified in the micu patient was started on zosyn and restarted on vancomycin wiht marked improvement in his respiratory status within a few days of returning to the floor vancomycin and zosyn were stopped as cxr showed resolution of questionable aspiration pneumonia this was felt to be more likely pneuomonitis which resolved after the micu patients delirium started to improve but then worsened when he returned to the or for removal of external fixation he developed fevers to f post operatively which likely worsened delirium source of fevers unclear of note patient had recently developed vre in his urine but infectious disease did not feel this was an active infection he received three days of antibiotics daptomycin and then linezolid when these were stopped he became afebrile and delirium began to lift aggitation was mostly controlled with haldol zyprexa was tried for two weeks but it did not seem to help acute aggitation qtc was monitored while patient was on antipsychotics and was stable at approximately msec overall etiology of delirium has remained unclear but was thought to be multifactorial due in part to chronic alcohol use hepatic encephalopathy benzodiazepine use and post operative delririum although spanish speaking sitters and interpreters were employed as much as possible language also likely contributed to persistance of delirium delirium has completely resolved patient is now restraint and sitter free all haldol has been stopped he has past the period of etoh withdrawal it is recommended that patient follow up with alcohol abuse counseling afib flutter while febrile his afib flutter was complicated by more frequent episodes of rapid ventricular rate this was controlled with iv metoprolol when needed but also by increasing po metoprolol and diltiazem treating fever with tylenol also seemed to help he was briefly put on therapeutic lovenox for atrial fibrillation but this was stopped as he was not felt to be eligible by chads criteria and also because of high fall risk patient was transitioned off of beta blockers and placed on diltiazem mg daily urinary retention patient failed several voiding trials he also pulled out his foley on several occasions causing hematuria intermittent straight catheterization was tried to reduce infection risk of long term indwelling foley however given delirium and aggitation this was untenable this

new pancytopenia had complicated course of ampl treatment leukemia patient found to have ampl via bone marrow biopsy the day of admission to the micu he was started on atra and monitored closely for symptoms of dic tls and atra syndrome he was transfused as needed with prbc platlets and ffp he did not develop overt signs of dic he was induced with ara c and daunurubicin his counts responded appropriatly a repeat bm biopsy showed remission and he will continue the atra for now and follow up with dr last name stitle for plans of stage two of his treatment fevers he initially was on vancomycin and cefepime when first starting treatment due to a hx of fevers at home but as his culture data was negative and he remained afebrile his antibiotics were discontinued he remained afebrile until when he spiked a fever he was cultured and his blood grew strep viridans he was started on vanco cefepime at that time he also had a headache the day he spiked and a ct was done showing what appeared to be brain abscesses his antibiotics were eventually broadened to vanco meropenem fluconzaole and flagyl for the brain abscesses he continued to spike though for approximately a week he complained of some thigh pain and we did an ultrasound showing bilateral fluid collections they were drained in ir and grew mssa he then developed a pneumonia during his febrile period and was transferred to the icu for several days he required o for a while after being discharged from the icu while in the icu his neutrophil count started to drop and it was worried that he might be having a drug effect his vanco was discontinued and his counts began to recover eventually he was on meropenem voriconazole and acyclovir and stopped having fevers a repeat ct scan showed resolution of his pna serial repeat head cts showed slow decrease in size of his abscesses and an mri of his thigh showed retained small fluid collections bilaterally the plan is to complete week course of the above antibiotics for his brain abscesses we will reimage his thighs with an mri as an outpatient and depending on those results he will either need surgical drainage or still prolonged course of abx he will follow up with id ich pt with multiple small ich sustained from fall with acute left sided head injury in the setting of profound thrombocytopenia ct head revealed small foci of intraparenchymal hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage no hydrocephalus or shift on follow up head ct revealed interval increase in hemorrhage but without appreciable midline shift or infarction the pts neurologic exam remained stable neurosurgery followed closely platlet goal was k a repeat head ct one month after a fall showed the brain abscesses that were discussed above neuro onc was consulted and followed along it was decided not to do a biopsy he also required heparin and then lovenox for dvts and repeat head cts while on these anticoaulants remained stable and without new bleeds thigh pain weakness etiology unclear and unable to get good exam as limited by pain this may be bone marrow pain no evidence of hematoma or cellulitis no bowel or bladder dysfunction no saddle anesthesia no focal spinal tenderness to indicate acute cord compression mri or the t l spine revealed no evidence of acute cord compression there was evidence of layering fluid likely from the sah although unlikely to be causing the pts leg pain nerve irritation secondary to blood neurosurgery recommended starting decadron on he was not kept on decadron because chemotherapy was initiated eventually he was found to have abscesses in his thighs as discussed above afib pt went into afib while in the icu his blood pressures remained stable and he was started on metoprolol his high rates were s s he contined to have afib on and off for about a week and then remained in nsr the week prior to discharge his metoprolol was titrated to mg tid for good rate control name ni pt had one episode of b name ni v afib with aberrancy cards was consulted and we did agressive electrolyte repletion and continued the metoprolol he did not have any more occurrences vasovagal bradycardia the day prior to admission while the patient was having a bowel movement he was noted on telemetry to brady to the s he felt light headed and it resolved in minutes appeared to be vaso vagal and he did not have any more occurrences again cards was consulted and they recommended leaving the metoprolol dose the same at mg tid as bb actually helps prevent vagal episodes dvts while patient was in the icu he developed bilaterally pedal edema thought initially to be due to large amount of ivfs because of his new afib though we did ultrasounds and found him to have dvts in r leg r arm because he was edematous and had pain around a new picc line heparin was started overnight but because of his hx of ichs it was decided to stop the heparin and place an ivc filter it was put in place without complications evenutally he was found to have bilaterally leg dvts and then bilateral upper extremity dvts at that point it was decided that he should be anticoagulated heparin was initially repeat head ct showed no bleed and then he was converted to lovenox for outpatient treatment of the dvts he also had a vq scan during these findings of dvt that showed low prob of pe access pt initially had a subclavian line then it was pulled while the patient was febrile in early month only he had pivs until transfer to the icu when a picc line was placed the picc line was removed after a dvt was found in the arm he again had pivs for a while until a ir guided subclavian line was placed for outpatient continuation of his week course of antibiotics a hickman was placed as piccs could not be placed due to bilateraly ue dvts pt was

awaiting trach placement ms known lastname also developed a ventilator associated pneumonia she grew mrsa in her sputum and blood and was treated with a course of vancomycin zosyn was added after days of vancomycin as she had repeated l lung collapse with thick mucous plugging and we wanted to cover for pneumonia as well subsequent surveillance cultures were clean zosyn was later switched to cefepime worsening renal failure attributed to zosyn she completed an day course of antibiotics her tracheostomy went well and she was started on an in exsufflator as well to aid in clearing her secretions mucous to prevent recurrent lung colapse a fib ms known lastname had several episodes of atrial fibrillation with rvr all in the setting of l lung collapse she was initially started on a

starting heparin she had an episode of guaiac positive stool and then a small amount of melena her heparin was stopped and was not restarted as she remained in sinus rhythm and the concern was that her risk of gi bleeding is higher than her risk of stroke her peg was lavaged and was ob negative she will also need a colonoscopy as an outpatient to further evaluate the cause of her melena she has

brief hospitalhospital course neurology mr known lastname was admitted to the icu for monitoring once it was discovered that his left sided was secondary to a right sided thalmocapsular hemorrhage in the icu he remained hemodynamically stable however his neurological exam worsened from left sided hemiparesis to essentially hemiplegia involving most of his left side including face arm and leg the differential included hypertensive hemorrhage mass aneurysm or hemorrhagic conversion of an embolic as the patient had little recorded or reportable medical history it is unclear that he had a history of htn but this was clearly the most likely diagnosis as no mass was observed and the mra was negtive for vascular malformation he was quite hypertensive at admission with bps s requiring iv hydralazine for control the patient had a deterioration in his mental status after transfer out of the icu an encephalopathy work up revealed bilateral pleural effusions thought to be secondary to possible aspiration pneumonia his antibiotic regimen was changed to levofloxacin and metronidazole and he became alert and oriented within hrs he should complete another days of levofloxacin and

recommendation was that this could be followed up as an outpatient id the patient had klebsiella pneumoniae urosepsis he was initially placed on gentamicin he subsequently had a drop in his platelets because the bacteria was also sensitive to ceftriaxone he was switched as there was concern that the thrombocytopenia low of was secondary to gentamicin once the gent was discontinued his platelets subsequently recovered to normal range he has been treated with levaquin iv and flagyl for days and should complete another days of these two antibiotics for the klebsiella and the pneumonia heme

seizure and mental status changes and was found to have seizure meningitis the patient presented with a seizure a fever to and altered mental status he was unable to answer questions about localizing symptoms meningitis was initially suspected due to skin rash though this was more maculopapular than petechial in nature on the first day of his hospitalization he received vancomycin ceftriaxone and acyclovir which would be appropriate empiric treatment of a non specified meningitis encephalitis unfortunately due to difficulties with obtaining an lp this was not performed until hospital day three and showed pleiocytosis and increased protein but was ultimately culture negative ultimately this was thought most consistent with partially treated bacterial meningitis therefore the patient was treated with vancomycin ceftriaxone with resolution of his fevers and improvement of his mental status to baseline without further seizures acyclovir was stopped when hsv pcr returned negative the patient will ultimately need to complete fourteen days of antibiotic therapy for meningitis seizure the patient has a previous history of seizures and has been on phenytoin his previous seizures have not been grand mal but this appears to have been the type that occurred on the day of presentation the likely precipitant of this seizure was the patients infection and fever though phenytoin level was also a bit low initially he was maintained on iv phenytoin then fospheynytoin but then transitioned back to his outpatient po regimen as mental status resolved he never showed signs of further seizure activity and eeg obtained to rule out further seizure activity was not consistent with persistent epileptiform activity allergic reaction respiratory failure the patient had a presentation of rash hypotension and per report swelling of the throat and tongue this could be consistent with acute allergic reaction and the tmp sulfa he had been given for cellulitis is certainly a potential causative doctor last name still it seems unlikely he would react suddenly and this remarkably to tmp sulfa after he had been receiving it for a full day nevertheless he was treated appropriately for an anaphylactic reaction with epinephrine histamine blocker and steroids and recovered respiratory failure as stated before it is difficult to tell if the patient actually had anaphylactic shock leading to airway compromise and respiratory failure other possible etiologies would include pulmonary edema given need for vigorous fluid resuscitation soon after presentation and oversedation in the emergency departments ultimately the patient was weaned off supplementary oxygen without event altered mental status per the patients mother at baseline he has the mental status of a small child with minimal verbal communication skills but he follows commands and interacts appropriately the patient was initially extremely somonolent and then minimally responsive raising concern for non convulsive status epilepticus eeg was more consistent with encephalopathy however and the patients mental status eventually resolved to baseline with treatment of his underlying condition and maximization of other variables likely this was due to toxic metabolic delirium in the context of severe infection history of dvt the patient has a history of two dvts and thus is presumably on lifelong anticoagulation his inr was initially supratherapeutic so further anticoagulation was held then he was transitioned to low molecular weight heparin for systemic anticoagulation while he was npo once he was eating warfarin was restarted and lmwh was stopped after hours of therapeutic inr on coumadin non sustained ventricular tachycardia on the morning of the patient had two brief runs of nsvt that broke without further management this was discussed with ep who thought barring signs of structural heart disease that this likely had no prognostic significance and was likely simply a response to acute illness the patient had an echocardiogram that was within normal limits and he had no further episodes of vt of note this also happened while he was being phenytoin loaded which may have contributed to arrythmia fen the patient initially required tube feeds due to altered mental status and lack of inclination to eat he self discontinued his dobhoff unfortunately and due to a desire to spare another invasive process if possible he was observed and thankfully had cleared enough to tolerate po in around forty eight hours after that he tolerated a full diet with out incident he

problem list is as follows septic shock purpura fulminans blood culture bottles at hospital hospital were positive for n meningitidis although near daily cultures of blood sputum and urine throughout the patients icu stay remained negative on admission to the icu the patient recieved a day course of xigris and a day course of empiric stress dose steroids hydrocortisone fludricortisone to treat his infection he had an d course of cephalosporin for meningococcemia recieved ceftriaxone x d then cefepime vancomycin and flagyl he persistently spiked nightly fevers to and he had a profound leukocytosis up to k with l shift culture data remained negative and his only source was a questionable lll pneumonia on cxr bedside flexible bronchoscopy and a bal were pristine so antibiotics were discontinued on hospital day he briefly defervesced after changing of his central venous catheter but then continued to have nightly fevers he recieved another d course of vancomycin cefepime and flagyl empirically when these antibiotics were discontinued his white count had normalized although he continued to have low grade fevers infectious disease was consulted upon admission and followed the patient throughout his hospital stay the patient also was noted to have progressive acral necrosis of his fingers and toes this was followed daily by the icu team and plastic hand surgery and podiatry were consulted there was no evidence of wet gangrene progressive infection and the necrosis was allowed to demarcate by discharge from the icu this had been stable for one week and the patients necrosis remained limited to the distal phalanxes of bilateral hands largely sparing the thumbs as well as the distal phalanx of bilateral feet occupational therapy was consulted to help the patient with this and the patient will be followed as an outpatient or at rehab by ot he also will follow up weekly with hand surgery and podiatry to assess need for amputation versus allowing auto amputation the patient also had diffuse lower extremity bullae and purpura which were cared for supportively with hospital bacitracin as well as xeroform dressings persistent fevers intravenous access was difficult to obtain and access was maintain via l subclavian central venous catheter this was removed in the setting of persistent fevers and ir placed a picc line blood cultures revealed methicillin resistant staph epidermidis and pt was started on vancomycin for day course c diff toxin assay were also positive and the patient was started on metronidazole pt was sent to or for surgical wound debridement with podiatry of the r foot wound cultures revealed pseudomonas and ceftazidime was started for full gram negative coverage acute renal failure upon admission the patient was noted to have a cr bun from presumed normal baseline this trended up to a maximum cr of on hd the renal team was following the patient throughout his stay and thought the renal failure was likely acute tubular necrosis from his sepsis dialysis was considered but the patient never met acute indications for dialysis he was treated prn with high dose diuretics lasix mg iv and diuril mg iv up to hospital for decreased urine output in the context of anasarca however predominately he was treated supportively and from hd his creatine began to trend down and he autodiuresed significantly by discharge from the icu his creatinine had normalized to respiratory failure the patient was intubated on arrival due to respiratory distress fatigue with profound metabolic acidosis initial chest xrays were consisted with ards and the patient was maintained on lung protective ventilation as mentioned above daily chest xrays showed questionable pneumonia versus pulmonary edema the patient was on vancomycin cefepime and flagyl and was also diuresed his chest xrays continued to show significant edema however his vent settings were able to be weaned over his stay he was not able to pass a spontaneous breathing trial and extubation was also deferred because the patient had significant oral lesions and glossal edema raising the concern for difficulty in reintubation the patient therefore recieved a tracheostomy tube and peg tube with thoracic surgery he tolerated the procedure well and postoperatively was quickly able to be transitioned to a trach mask then a passamuir valve over the course of days his respiratory status remained stable throughout the remainder of his icu stay cardiovascular system the patient had several different cardiovascular issues during his stay on hd an echo showed severely depressed lv function with estimated ef repeat echo on hd showed improved but still severly depressed lv function ef this was not repeated during his icu stay he also had one episode of non sustained beats ventricular tachycardia his hemodynamics were stable and his electrolytes were normal at this time however and he had no further episodes of similar tachycardias he was maintained on telemetry throughout this stay he did have elevation of his cardiac biomarkers which peaked on hospital day with a troponin t of his cks had been elevated thought due to his acral necrosis and his ekgs were unchanged the troponinemia was ascribed to his renal failure and systolic heart failure as opposed to an nstemi and indeed the rise and fall improved with resolution of his renal function he should have a repeat echo as an outpatient in weeks after hospital discharge additionally after resolution of his initial sepsis the patient was persistently tachycardic hr usually s s up to s always sinus rhythm and hypertensive sbps up to s s the etiology was thought to be due to a combination of pain anxiety and fevers and a generalized state of sympathetic excess the patient was started on amlodipine hydralizine and metoprolol neurologic as the patients sedation was weaned in advance of possible extubation he was noted to have questionable neurologic deficits specifically he was not moving his upper extremities spontaneously and while he was able to follow commands by eye blinking he did not appear to demonstrate any tracking movements with his eyes as he had been on xigris and also had significant microvascular pathology in other organ systems an mri head cspine was obtained to rule out intracerebral or spinal hematoma bleeds or infection this examination was normal an ophthamologic consult was also obtained to perform a dilated pupil retinal exam this showed diffuse bilateral retinal hemorrhages and outpatient follow up was reccomended his tracking gaze and upper extremity movement continued to improve as sedation was weaned fluids nutrition the patient was maintained on tube feeds throughout his admission initially he had high residuals and therefore was supplemented with parenteral nutrition nutrition service provided useful reccomendations by discharge the patient had passed a speech and swallow examination and was tolerating po intake with his pm valve in place from a fluids standpoint the patient required initial aggressive fluid rescuscitation for his sepsis and insensible volume losses and was significantly volume overloaded throughout his stay although this improved dramatically with forced and auto diuresis and improvement of his renal function transfer to floor the patients renal failure normalized his creatinine returned to normal the patient was breathing room air through a tracheostomy tube the trach tube was removed on soon afterward he was tolerating po food the g tube was removed on the patient spiked low grade temperatures until when his temperature remained below f cultures were positive for the following mrse in blood and wound culture in blood in wound c diff yeast in wound cultures in wound culture pseudomonas in wound cultures in wound culture for these organisms the patient was continued on vancomycin started cefepime to ciprofloxacin started and metronidazole started he will continue to get a full six week course of these antibiotics his foot wounds were dressed daily by podiatry using duoderm gel on dry sterile dressings and xenoform on leg wounds bacitracin on leg bullae his fingers were dressed with dry sterile dressing between the fingers to minimize maceration the patient is discharged to a rehab facility in stable condition for continued physical therapy daily dressing changes and iv antibiotic treatment vancomycin he requires substantial pain control especially for his dressing changes and he has developed a tolerance to morphine his pain is controlled with mg morphine every morning before dressing changes and he has tolerated a sliding scale of morphine mg for physical therapy and any additional dressing changes or examinations of the wounds he is

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 75-year-old female
with a history of Alzheimer's dementia, coronary artery
disease status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2174**] with
a history of five myocardial infarctions, the last in [**2185-7-28**] as well as congestive heart failure with an ejection
fraction of 30%, hypertension, dyslipidemia.  On [**2185-11-11**],
she experienced transient episodes of left arm weakness
associated with slow speech.  Her husband called the
patient's doctor who recommended she present to the emergency
room.

On arrival her vital signs were stable.  Labs were
unremarkable.  Cardiac enzymes were negative initially.  She
was admitted to the Neurology for work up of a question of
TIA or stroke.  She underwent MRI of the head upon admission
that was negative for an acute process.  While on the floor
on [**2185-11-11**], she was noted to become tachycardic in a sinus
rhythm to 150 and was noted to have rales on exam.  She was
given 40 mg of IV Lasix without significant response; she
received a second dose of 40 mg IV Lasix and then a code was
called when she subsequently was noted to drop her oxygen
saturation to the mid 80s on 100% nonrebreather.  She also
became hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure in the 70s.

She was intubated and briefly required Dopamine to maintain
her blood pressures.  She was then transferred to the
Coronary Care Unit for further management of congestive heart
failure.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery
bypass graft in [**2174**].
2.  Diabetes mellitus.
3.  Dyslipidemia.
4.  Congestive heart failure, ejection fraction 30%.
5.  Alzheimer's dementia.

Her primary care physician is [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) 1537**].  Her
neurologist is Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

9.  Folate 1 mg p.o. b.i.d.
10. Lanoxin 0.125 mg p.o. q. Monday, Wednesday and Friday and
0.25 Tuesday, Thursday, Sunday.

ALLERGIES:
1.  Sulfa.
2.  Iodine.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with her husband.  She does not
smoke or drink.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Upon admission to the Coronary Care
Unit, she was intubated and sedated.  She had pink, frothy
sputum suctioned from her G tube.  Her lungs had audible
rales at the bases.  She had a regular rate and rhythm
audible upon precordial exam with no audible extra heart
sounds.  Her abdomen was benign with positive bowel sounds.
She had no edema with 1+ distal pulses.  She was responding
to stimuli, but was sedated.

LABORATORY:  Upon admission to the Coronary Care Unit had a
sodium 134, potassium 4.4, chloride 97, bicarbonate 25, BUN
20, creatinine 0.7, glucose 124, INR 1.1.  White count 7,
hematocrit 33, platelets 211.

EKG normal sinus rhythm at 90 beats per minute with a left
axis, left bundle branch block.  There was no comparison
available at the time.

Chest x-ray with patchy vascular markings consistent with
congestive heart failure.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The initial impression on admission to the
Coronary Care Unit was that the patient was a 75 year-old
female with severe coronary artery disease who developed
symptoms of left arm discomfort on the day prior to
admission.  It may or may not have represented anginal type
symptoms.  She was now admitted directly from the floor in
apparently decompensated congestive heart failure in the
setting of elevated systolic blood pressure (as high as 200).

The patient was able to be weaned off of Dopamine
expeditiously upon admission to the Coronary Care Unit.  She
was diuresed aggressively and successfully with IV Lasix.
She had a PA catheter placed upon admission in order to guide
her management with initial pulmonary artery pressures of
35/10 and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 10.  Of note,
this was following aggressive diuresis.

The patient did well with subsequent titration up of after
load reduction with Captopril and initiation of Isordil.  She
was able to be extubated successfully on [**2185-11-14**].  She
underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram which revealed a
severely depressed LV function with ejection fraction of 20
to 30% and akinesis of the inferior row posterior walls and
moderate hypokinesis at the LV as well as 1+ AR and MR.

The patient subsequently did well and at the time of this
dictation on [**2185-11-17**], she is awaiting transfer to the
General Medical Floor where she will await eventual
disposition most likely to short term rehab.

Service:  Cardiology

The patient is a 75-year-old female with a past medical
history of Alzheimer's dementia, coronary artery disease,
status post coronary artery bypass grafting, multiple
myocardial infarctions, ischemic cardiomyopathy with an
ejection fraction of 20-30% and hypertension.  The patient
was admitted for episodes of left arm weakness and developed
flash pulmonary edema and tachycardia in the hospital.  She
was transferred to the CCU for medical management and
diuresis.  The patient responded to treatment well and, on
[**2185-11-17**], she was transferred to the floor for further
medical care prior to discharge to rehabilitation.

The patient was stable throughout her course of
hospitalization on the medical floor.  She was restarted on
her preadmission medications.  Her congestive heart failure
was not an acute issue.  She was kept euvolemic throughout
the hospitalization and suffered no additional shortness of
breath, pulmonary edema or tachycardia.  Her blood pressure
did drop on occasion to 80-90/40.  The patient was
asymptomatic during these episodes and blood pressure
elevated spontaneously to greater than 100/50.

The patient had fevers in the CCU with negative blood
cultures.  She was started empirically on Levofloxacin and
Metronidazole.

On the hospital floor, she was noted to have one bloody
stool.  Hematocrit was stable.  The patient's family notes
that the patient has been having bloody stools on occasion
over the past few years.  They have related to her congestive
heart failure exacerbations.  The patient underwent an
abdominal CT which showed evidence of proctitis to a very
mild degree with some thickening of the bowel wall and
stranding.  The CT also noted an abnormally thickened and
calcified gallbladder wall with a question of worrisome
gallbladder.  The patient was referred go Gastroenterology.
She underwent a liver/gallbladder ultrasound which revealed
cholelithiasis and evidence of adenomyomatosis, a benign
non-premalignant condition for which no follow up is
necessary.  Due to the patient's age and presentation, late
onset of ulcerative colitis was suspected for the occasional
bloody stools.  On flexible sigmoidoscopy, the patient was
shown to have multiple non-bleeding rectal ulcers.  The
appearance was consistent with ulcerative colitis.  Biopsies
were taken and the results are pending.  Due to the patient's
very mild disease activity without pain and only occasional
bloody stools without a drop in hematocrit, it is not clear
at this time whether treatment with steroids or 5-ASA enemas
is indicated.  The patient will follow up with
Gastroenterology for these issues.  The patient's hematocrit
was stable throughout the admission.  The patient's diet was
advanced and she took p.o. well.

The patient is discharged in good condition to long term
rehabilitation.

.
IMAGING:
[**12-7**] CT C/A/P: TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images were obtained from
the chest, abdomen and pelvis with the administration of IV
contrast. Multiplanar reformats were generated and reviewed.
CT OF THE CHEST: Right pleural effusion with adjacent
compressive
atelectasis. Left base opacification likely represents collapsed
left lower lobe which appears airless and filled with higher
density material, possibly blood. The patient has a nasogastric
tube which passes into the stomach. ETT tube appears
approximately 4.7cm above the carina.
The visualized heart and pericardium are unremarkable.
CT OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS: The intra-[**Month/Day (4) 1676**] vasculature
and
intra-[**Month/Day (4) 1676**] solid organs are incompletely evaluated in the
absence of IV contrast. Within this limitation, the liver,
pancreas, and bilateral adrenal glands appear unremarkable. Note
is made of splenomegaly. Both kidneys show no evidence of large
masses. A non-obstructive 9-mm stone is noted within the lower
pole of the left kidney (601B, 32). Small stones are noted
within the right kidney. The patient is status post
cholecystectomy.
Surgical sutures are noted in the RLQ, otherwise,
intra-[**Month/Day (4) 1676**] loops of
large and small bowel appear unremarkable. There is no free air
or free fluid within the abdomen. Retroperitoneal and mesenteric
lymph nodes do not meet size criteria for pathologic
enlargement.
The structures within the pelvis are incompletely evaluated due
to the
presence of streak artifact due to bilateral total hip
replacements. Within this limitation, the patient is status post
a Foley catheter. A right femoral vein catheter is identified. A
possible rectal catheter is noted. Bilateral hip prosthesis are
noted; the right femoral component appears well seated within
the acetabular component; however, the left femoral component is
not well seated within the left acetabular component.
Decrease in vertebral body height of L1 vertebral body is noted
with possible retropulsion of fragment into the spinal canal and
indentation of the thecal sac. This is of indeterminate
chronicity, but likely represents more chronic process with the
presence of what looks like kyphoplasty material within L1
vertebral body. Intra-[**Month/Day (4) 1676**] vasculature is not well
evaluated in the absence of contrast technique.

IMPRESSION:
1. Right pleural effusion with adjacent compressive atelectasis.
Left base
opacification likely represents collapsed left lower lobe which
appears
airless and filled with higher density material, possibly blood.

2. Left lower pole renal calculus.
3. Incomplete evaluation of the pelvis due to streak artifact.
4. Left total hip arthroplasty prosthesis shows femoral
component is not well seated within the acetabular component.
5. Loss of vertebral body height of L1 vertebral body with
possible
retropulsion of fragments into the spinal canal; this is of
indeterminate
chronicity, however, appears to be chronic due to presence of
what appears to be kyphoplastic material.
.
[**12-7**] CT HEAD:TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained
through the head without the administration of IV contrast.
Multiplanar reformats were generated and reviewed.
There is no evidence of acute fracture or traumatic dislocation.
Bilateral
mastoid air cells are clear. Minimal mucosal thickening is noted
within
bilateral maxillary sinuses.
There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage, discrete
masses, mass effect or shift of normally midline structures. The
ventricles and sulci are normal in size and configuration.
[**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation is preserved with no evidence
of large acute major vascular territory infarction.
IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial pathological process.
ADDENDUM AT ATTENDING REVIEW: There is marked anterior rotation
of the
odontoid process relative to a thickened appearance of the body
of C2. The
finding likely represents a fracture/subluxation deformity.
There is resultant prominent central canal narrowing at this
level. There is no prevertebral soft tissue swelling at this
locale. It is possible that the finding represents a prior,
healed fracture, but clearly this question must be resolved,
through either obtaining prior records/imaging studies
immediately, and/or subsequent spinal CT imaging. In the
meantime, the patient's neck needs to be stabilized.
.
[**12-8**] CT CSPINE: COMPARISON: CT head from [**2160-12-7**] and
portable C-spine radiograph from [**2160-12-7**].

TECHNIQUE: Helical 2.5-mm axial MDCT sections were obtained from
the skull
base through the level of T2. Sagittal and coronal reformations
were obtained and reviewed.

FINDINGS: There is a large mass of new bone formation causing
fusion of the C1 and C2 vertebral bodies anteriorly, with
anterior subluxation of C1 with respect to C2(400b:27). This
results in severe encroachment on the spinal canal by the
posterior arch of C1. The degree of subluxation is unchanged
from the prior study. There is no fracture identified.
There is extensive fusion of every facet joint from C2 to T3,
comprising all the levels imaged. There is also interbody fusion
involving every cervical level. There has been surgical anterior
fusion at C6-7. There is extensive fusion of the lamina and
interlaminar ligaments throughout the visualized levels. In the
portion of thoracic spine included in the study, there is fusion
of costovertebral and costotransverse articulations. Comparison
with a torso CT of [**2160-12-8**] reveals similar ankylosis in the
lumbar spine and sacroiliac joints. These findings indicate a
spondyloarthropathy with manifestations typical of ankylosing
spondylitis. Correlation with the remainder of her medical
history will be helpful.

IMPRESSION:
1. Anterior subluxation of C1 on C2 without evidence of
fracture. The
anterior arch of C1 is fused to the odontoid process via a thick
layer of bone that contributes to the subluxation. This produces
severe encroachment on the spinal canal by the posterior arch of
C1.
2. There are extensive fusions of multiple spinal joints most
suggestive of ankylosing spondylitis.
3. No evidence of acute fracture.
.
[**12-7**] PELVIS PLAIN FILM: Comparison is made to selected images
from an [**Month/Day (4) 1676**] pelvic CT scan dated [**2160-12-7**].

SINGLE PORTABLE AP PELVIC FILM WAS OBTAINED [**2160-12-7**] AT 0452:
Bilateral total hip replacements are seen. The femoral and
acetabular
components appear to be well approximated on this single AP
view. The distal end of both femoral components is not included
on the image. There is no evidence of loosening of the femoral
components. Hypertrophic bone is seen lateral to the right
femoral component. A right femoral catheter is in place. No
displaced fracture of the pelvis is appreciated. Surgical chain
sutures are seen in the right lower quadrant, suggesting prior
colonic surgery. A Foley catheter is in place. Several
radiopaque densities are seen lateral to the left femoral
component within the soft tissues which may be sutural in
etiology. Clinical correlation is advised.

IMPRESSION:
Bilateral total hip replacements with both appearing to be
normally positioned on this single portable view. No evidence of
displaced fracture of the pelvis.

Left upper extremity ultrasound [**2160-12-11**]:
IMPRESSION: Non-occlusive thrombus within one of two paired
brachial veins, which extends to the axillary vein.

Portable chest x-ray [**2160-12-11**]:
IMPRESSION: Persistent sizable parenchymal infiltrate in left
lower lobe
area. No new abnormalities in this portable chest examination.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 40984**] is a 46 year old female with a history of suicide
attempts and subsequent liver disease, multiple infections
including ESBL Klebsiella and osteomyelitis who takes chronic
steroids for ankylosis spondylitis presented from an outside
hospital intubated and requiring pressors.
.
ACTIVE PROBLEMS BY ISSUE:
# Acute metabolic acidosis without respiratory compensation:
Her pH upon admission to ICU was 7.1 with a bicarb of 14, later
worsened to 7.09 with bicarb of 12.  The possible etiologies of
her primary metabolic acidosis include intoxication versus
sepsis.  The active [**Doctor Last Name 360**]/s seem to have suppressed her
respiratory drive (additional respiratory acidosis) as well as
causing a primary metabolic acidosis.  She was treated with IV
fluids with bicarbonate as well as hyperventilation on
mechanical ventilation in order to improve the acidosis and
elevated pCO2.  Also, the toxicology and psychiatry services
were consulted to assist with identifying the cause of her
ingestion.  Finally, she was started empirically on
piperacillin/tazobactam with vancomycin to cover for possible
aspiration pneumonia.
.
# Respiratory failure: She was intubated upon arrival but able
to be ventilated well including a recruitment procedure to open
her atelectatic lung seen on CT.  She was extubated easily and
did well on room air afterwards.  As discussed above, it was
thought that she aspirated while she was impaired from an
unknown ingestion.  Her CT chest was consistent with some small
bilateral pneumonia.  Following stabilization and extubation,
induced sputum results returned positive for MRSA.  She
completed a 7 day course of vancomycin.  She remained afebrile
throughout remainder of course on the medical floor.  PICC was
discontinued prior to [**Doctor Last Name **].
.
# Hypotension:  Pt was hypotensive on admission to ICU.  Her
hypotension is of unclear etiology.  It seems possible that she
had sepsis--likely from pneumonia.  Also, she may have been down
long enough to miss her home florinef dose, resulting in
hypotension.  Lastly, the ingestion itself could have caused
hypotension.  She was treated with IV fluids, antibiotics as
above, and stress doses of steroids.  Blood pressures were
stable during floor course.  She was started on captopril when
she became hypertensive with subsequent good control.
.
# Psychologic issues:  We suspect that she had a purposeful
ingestion with suicidal attempt.  Blood tox was positive for
benzos and tricyclics.  Urine tox was positive for benzos,
cocaine, and opiates.  However, the patient did not admit
suicide ideation; she intermittently reported that she may have
accidentally ingested more medications than intended. Psychiatry
was consulted and they recommended a 1:1 sitter.  She was placed
on section 12.  She was followed by psychiatry and often refused
full interviewing.  She did not admit to suicide ideation but
given her prior suicide attempts and depression with inability
to care for herself, she was transferred to psych facility for
further care.  All of her psychiatric medications were held
during hospital stay.  She was started on low dose seroquel on
the floor prior to transfer to help with sleep.
.
# Rhabdomyolysis:  Her admission Creatinine was 2.2 (baseline is
< 1.0) with phosphate >7 and CK of [**Numeric Identifier 24587**].  She was treated with
IV fluids and alkalinization of the urine (with bicarb).  Her
creatinine improved to baseline and her CK trended down quickly.
.
# Transaminitis:  She has a history of liver disease secondary
to toxic ingestions.  Her AST/ALT ratio suggests EtOH damage.
APAP < 2 at OSH.  LFTs normalized by time of [**Numeric Identifier **].
.
# Odontoid fracture and Hip dislocation:  Patient originally
arrived in the ED with dislocated hip which was reduced.
However, while intubated she awoke and again dislocated her hip
while agitated.  It has been put in a brace after a second
reduction.  Her CT head showed an old odontoid fracture,
confirmed with CT neck.  She was kept immobilized until cleared
by ortho spine team.  For her hip, ortho recommended that she
continue with posterior hip precautions.  She is weight bearing
as tolerated.
.
# Left upper extremity DVT:  Patient failed bilateral internal
jugular central lines in the outside hospital and then failed a
left subclavian and left IR-guided PICC here.  Imaging looks
like there is some type of central obstruction, L
brachiocephalic vein no flow past it on venogram.  She was
eventually able to get a midline at level of axillary.
Ultrasound showed left upper extremity DVT.  She was initially
started on heparin gtt with coumadin.  She was then transitioned
to lovenox with coumadin.  INR was therapeutic for several days
between 2 and 3 by time of [**Numeric Identifier **] on 3mg of warfarin daily.
Pt currently is at risk of falling (due to her ankylosing
spondylitis and hip dislocations) and syncope from substance
abuse.  However, given that she will be transferred to an
extended care facility, it was felt that benefits of
anticoagulation would outweigh the risks at this time. When
ready for [**Numeric Identifier **], there should be another discussion of
anticoagulation.   After rehabilitation from both physical and
mental viewpoint, risks/benefits of anticoagulation should be
re-assessed.  In the meantime, fall precautions should be
continued at psych facility
.
# Diarrhea: Pt had several loose BMs daily.  C.diff was negative
x 2.  Given amount of diarrhea, she was empirically started on
oral flagyl 500mg TID.  C.diff PCR was sent in the meantime.
PCR returned negative and flagyl was discontinued.  She was
started on immodium with symptomatic relief
.
# Tinea corporis: Pt had several macular patches on lower back
and right leg with central clearing.  This was consistent with
tinea corporis.  She was treated with clotrimazole cream [**Hospital1 **].
.
# Pain control: Pt with longstanding history of narcotic use.
She frequently demanded IV dilaudid for nonspecific complaints,
including [**Hospital1 1676**] pain.  Also has ankylosing spondylitis, left
hip dislocation, and left hand IV infiltration of levophed from
OSH that can contribute to pain. Pain consult obtained who
recommended maintaining current narcotic regimen of oral
dilaudid q6h.  She was also given lidoderm patch and ibuprofen

after bolus fluids for [**Last Name (un) **] given poor PO intake and elevated Cr
on labs (felt to be pre-renal) and lasix held yesterday. However
after fluids bolus of 1L, pt became hypoxic to 85% w/crackles. K
elevated to 5.5 at [**Hospital **] rehab, got kayexalete. She was then
given 60mg lasix w/out much improvement despite diuresis at
which point transferred to [**Hospital1 18**]. Pt has had gradual decline in
MS (somnolent, but no confusion). Also developed large tongue
and protruding lower lip concerning for angioedema in setting of

CXR [**2171-4-5**]:
There is severe cardiomegaly associated also with bilateral
hilar enlargement, findings that might be consistent with
complex valvular problems as well as cardiomyopathy. There are
most likely present bilateral pleural effusions.  There is no
evidence of pulmonary edema. Calcified right pleural plaques are
redemonstrated. There is no evidence of pneumothorax

TTE [**2171-4-5**]:
The left atrium is elongated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Tissue Doppler imaging
suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure
(PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus,
ascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets
are mildly thickened (?#). There is mild aortic valve stenosis
(valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is seen. There
is mild functional mitral stenosis (mean gradient 6 mmHg) due to
mitral annular calcification. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is
normal. There is no pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Mild left ventricular
hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular systolic
function. Mild aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation. Mild
functional mitral stenosis from annular calcification.

Brief Hospital Course:
84yo w/PMHx significant for HTN, CKD, CVA (hemiplegia in [**2155**]),
diastolic heart failure, HLD, PVD refered from [**Hospital 100**] rehab for
hypoxia after receiving IVF, along with tongue and lip swelling
for the last few days concerning for angioedema.

ANGIOEDEMA: the patient was seen by the allergy consult team
([**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2602**] [**Doctor Last Name 2603**]) who thought this was consistent with angioedema,
she was started on dexamethasone 4mg q8hrs and H2 blockers.  her
symptoms improved and she was sent to the regular medical wards
from the ICU.  Her steroids were tapered to 2mg po q8hrs on [**4-8**]
and stopped completely on [**4-9**].

PULMONARY EDEMA: She improved with blood pressure control.  Her
home lasix of 40mg po daily was restarted on [**4-9**] as she had
some rales at the R base of her lung and mild shortness of
breath.  Her O2 sat was 95% on room air.  Her creatinine had
improved.  In addition for BENIGN HYPERTENSION her ACEi had been
stopped as noted above and she was started on hydralazine 25mg
po q6hrs, her nifedipine was increased to 60mg po bid (from 40mg
po bid) and her imdur was increased from 30mg po daily to 60mg
po daily.

ACUTE ON CHRONIC RENAL FAILURE: urine electrolytes consistent
with a pre-renal cause but given recent angiogram this also
could be related to contrast nephropathy.  Her renal failure
improved with time and blood pressure control.  Her creatinine
at discharge was 2.3 (baseline 2-2.2).  Chem 7 should be checked
in the next 5-7 days to ensure stability.

TOE ULCERATION, PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE: non infected toe
ulceration.  She had a recent angiogram and will f/u with
podiatry and vascular surgery (appointments have been made)

URINARY TRACT INFECTION: Started on PO cipro on [**2171-4-5**]. She has
completed a 5 day total course.

POSITIVE BLOOD CULTURE: on [**4-4**], this was treated with
vancomycin until it returned as 1/2 bottles from one set of coag
negative staph.  At this point she did not have a PICC or mid
line or any other foreign body.  She was afebrile and had no
white blood cell elevation, her vancomycin was last dosed on
[**2171-4-6**] (1 gram IV), this was likely a contaminant so
antibiotics were discontinued.

DIABETES TYPE II: the patient was on pioglitazone as an
outpatient, given pulmonary edema this was stopped.  While inpt
on steroids she was treated with an insulin sliding scale, on
discharge she was switched to glipizide xl 2.5mg po daily, this
can be further adjusted as an outpatient.

For her history of CVA with chronic left sided hemiparesis and
depression as well as iron and B12 deficiency anemia, the
patient continued on her home med regimen.

Imaging/results:
CTU [**10-16**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Appropriate position and function of the right ureteral
stent. No
evidence for obstruction.
2. Abnormality in the right lower pole as described above is
likely a sequela from prior percutaneous nephrostomy tube
placement. Please correlate with patient's history. There is no
evidence for a renal abscess.
3. 4-mm stone in the distal ureter.
4. 2.1 cm mass in the endometrial cavity. This may represent a
submucosal fibroid; however, differential diagnosis includes
endometrial polyp or carcinoma. Further evaluation with
ultrasound is recommended.
5. Findings consistent with hematocolpos. Please correlate with
menstrual status.

Brief Hospital Course:
Briefly, 45year old female who is otherwise healthy was found to
have obstructing kidney stone in [**9-12**], which was then
complicated by UTI and hydro requiring cystoscopy with stent
placement [**9-26**], found pus, developed florid urosepsis (wbc 40,
bandemia), UCx Ecoli, Rx Iv Abx in ICU then d/c'd [**10-4**] with
bactrim, completed course. Saw GU on [**10-7**], found to have urinary
retention, foley placed, fell out at some point. Seen again at
OSH ER [**10-11**] with new fever/abd pain, had urinary retention,
mildly dirty UA, got IV levaquin X3days, then d/c [**10-14**] on
bactrim and foley. Cultures negative at that time but pt did
have bandemia. Then on [**10-15**], had pain and LE cramps, called
PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] neg, went to ER because of low fevers, but d/c home.
that night, [**10-15**] developed fever 103.8, back to ER,
hypotensive, mildly dirty UA, got vanc/rocephin, transfered to
[**Hospital1 18**] for urosepsis, got 2L OSH, 2L here, and levophed started
in ER and RIJ placed and t/f to ICU. Started vanc/meropenem. 2L
more IVF given [**10-16**] (total 6-7L) and pressors weaned off [**10-16**]
midday, then HDS. last temp 101.4 on [**10-17**] am, afebrile since.
All Cx NTD. Vanc d/c'd on [**10-17**]. Kept on meropenem. CT nothing
acute, stent in place, no perinephric abcess, etc. Other
infectious w/u with CXR, blood cx, flu, echo negative. Pt
transfered out of ICU on [**10-17**]. On transfer to floor, low grade
temps, afebrile by next day. Tolerated PO and walking around.
Was emotional given her protracted illness. OSH cultures from
[**10-16**] UCx and Blood cx all negative. Given her improvement with
meropeneum and presumed failure with bactrim and allergy to
fluroquinolones and PCN, decision made to complete 14days with
ertapenum (day [**4-13**] on discharge). PICC placed prior to d/c. VNA
set up for teaching and monitoring and safety labs. Discussed
plan with patient and her current PCP (who is Ob/Gyne) Dr
[**Last Name (STitle) **] who will follow up on labs. He will refer her to a PCP
since her medical problems are a bit more complex than previous.
She was also interested in f/u here with Urology. Appt made for
[**10-29**] with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. this will be after completion of her Abx and
the hope is that she can have more definitive treatment by
removal of the stone and stent at that time. She also has had
recent issues with urinary retention, likely complication of her
illness and narcotics. She is told not to have any decath trials
until her stone/stent issue has resolved given high risk for
repeat infeciton in case of retention. Thereafter she can have
decath trials per GU or further w/u if fails. Rest of her plan
is outlined below.
.
.
Below is progress note from day of discharge:
.
45year old female with complicated recent urological history
with obstsructing stone s/p stent [**9-26**] complicated by urosepsis,
then urinary retention and recurrent [**Hospital **] transfered from OSH
with fevers/hypotension, presumed urosepsis.  t/f out of ICU on
[**10-17**].
.
.
Sepsis, presumed urosepsis: UA mildly dirty (had been on
bactrim) but has stent in place and stone which may be nidus,
all in setting of urinary retention and foley.
-continue meropenem for now, day [**4-17**]-->will give a dose of
Ertepenum before d/c to make sure tolerates. Plan is for 14day
course. PICC to be placed today (afebrile since [**10-17**] am,
cultures neg) and safety labs in one week
-f/u OSH Urine Cx from [**10-16**] and blood cx are NTD
-discussed with urology, made appt with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**10-29**] at
8am(once Abx course completed), for removal of stone/stent for
more definitive treatment
-foley in place as below
-reviewed lower pole findings with urology/radiology as pt did
not have PCN-they are not concerned
.
.
Fever: as above, presumed urinary source. CXR neg. flu neg. no
diarrhea. no other localizing complaints. Possible related to
bactrim but wouldnt have expected sepsis picture with drug
fever. S/p vanc [**10-16**] and [**10-17**], stopped.
-plan is for two weeks ertapenem
.
.
Urinary retention: unclear cause but definately contributing to
recurrent UTIs. may be due to narcotics patient was Rx during
1st hospitalization in [**9-12**]
-keep foley in for now, will need close follow up with GU here
for further management
-flomax 0.4
.
.
Leukopenia: from review of OSH records, it appears pt mounted a
white count as high as 40 when septic. Recently she has been
more leukopenic. Suspect due to bactrim.
-follow as outpt. will need safety labs on Abx.
.
.
Constipation: no BM Xseveral days, then had one on [**10-18**]
-add senna and dulcolax
-abdominal exam benign
.
.
Anemia: microcytic, likely Fe deficient based on Fe studies. Hgb
currently [**8-12**], recently baseline was 10s from OSH. Likely has
acute illness/ACD component. No obvious bleeding or hemolysis.
stable.
-start Fe supp with colace on discharge
-needs outpt further w/u
.
.
Nephrolithiasis: complicated history as above. recurrent
Urosepsis. Has 4mm stone and stent in place.
-discussed with urology, appointment [**10-29**] as above for
definitive treatment
.

Dispo/Code: full code. will try to get PICC today and arrange
for home Abx and teaching. f/u wtih Dr.[**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**10-29**]. Pt to f/u
with PCP in one week for labs.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for another infection of your urinary tract.
You keep having these infections likely because of an infected
stone. You were treated wtih a strong antibiotic with
improvement (meropenem) and you will go home on a similar
antibiotic (ertepenum) for 10more days (14days total). You have
an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (STitle) **] this on [**10-29**] where he will
discuss removal of the stone and stent to prevent further
infections.
you will have blood draw in one week while you are on the
antibiotic. please make sure the results are forwarded to Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] and call him the next day to discuss
Please keep the foley catheter in until urology says it is okay
to remove. Your urinary retention may take some time to resolve.

You are also started on iron supplements and stool softeners.
Your anemia shows that you are Iron deficient. This may be due
to your periods if they are heavy. However, if your periods are
not heavy then you should ask your primary care doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]
workup on other causes of anemia if your levels remain low.
